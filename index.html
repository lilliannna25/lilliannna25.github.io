<h1>My Goal For Study Aborad</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>I'm a first-year student from Pitzer College, and I'm very interested in studying and living in Germany for a while.
<br>I'm currently taking German 01(and introductory course) and planning continue studying German until the end of Sophomore year.
<br>I would prefer study in German for summer break or winter break. If that plan doesn't work out, I will consider apply for a nonapproved Program to study in Germany during my Junior year.
<br>I had been to Germany three times for two weeks travel and would like to explore this country in a more in-depth way.
<br>This website is for my exploration in order to gain a better understanding that helps me to make the final decision.

<h3>Why Germany?</h3>
<p>

<b>Reasons for Germany:</b>
<small><br><mark>1. Personal Connection and Previous Visits</mark><br>

I have spent a total of six weeks in Germany over three separate trips. During those visits, I enjoyed the environment, the cities, the public transportation, and the overall atmosphere. These experiences made me curious to learn more about local life beyond tourism.<br>

<mark>2. High-Quality Education</mark><br>

German universities are globally respected for:

Strong academic programs ;Research excellence ; Accessible summer/winter schools ; Affordable or free tuition<br>

<mark>3. Learning a New Language</mark><br>

I want to continue improving my German. Being in Germany would allow me to practice the language naturally in daily life, accelerating my progress beyond the classroom.

<br><mark>4. Cultural Exploration</mark><br>
Germany offers:
Rich history; Diverse regions and traditions; International communities; Cultural openness and academic freedom; Studying there would allow me to understand another culture more deeply and develop a more global perspective.
